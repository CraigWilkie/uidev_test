UI exercise
==============================

Overview
--------

We are interested in your approach to the following project. Each of the given tasks have a handful of valid solutions, and possibly other solutions we haven't seen, so don't worry about finding "the" solution. It should render correctly in all major browsers and devices, and be responsive from mobile to desktop.

Try to create your HTML as pixel perfect as possible but we understand type sizes will not be 100% accurate as working from flat artwork.
You should try to complete the task in under 1 hour, so plan accordingly and focus on the most important aspects.

Getting started
---------------
Fork this project.

Task #1
-----------
Create a full width page with a header, a footer and a main section in index.html. Set the width of the content section to 100% with a maximum width of 1366 pixels.

index.html should include these assets:

- jQuery (if a dependency in your solution)
- `test.js`
- `test.css`
- `Nunito` Google font in regular, bold and extra bold weights

Task #2
-----------

In the header, content and footer sections of index.html build the included design.

Task #3

Create the roll over state as shown in the design. 

Finish up
